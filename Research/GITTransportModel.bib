  abstract = {There are two classes of glucose transporters involved in glucose homeostasis in the body, the facilitated transporters or uniporters (GLUTs) and the active transporters or symporters (SGLTs). The energy for active glucose transport is provided by the sodium gradient across the cell membrane, the Na+ glucose cotransport hypothesis first proposed in 1960 by Crane. Since the cloning of SGLT1 in 1987, there have been advances in the genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics, and structure of SGLTs. There are 12 members of the human SGLT (SLC5) gene family, including cotransporters for sugars, anions, vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids. Here we give a personal review of these advances. The SGLTs belong to a structural class of membrane proteins from unrelated gene families of antiporters and Na+ and H+ symporters. This class shares a common atomic architecture and a common transport mechanism. SGLTs also function as water and urea channels, glucose sensors, and coupled-water and urea transporters. We also discuss the physiology and pathophysiology of SGLTs, e.g., glucose galactose malabsorption and familial renal glycosuria, and briefly report on targeting of SGLTs for new therapies for diabetes.},

We characterized postprandial BF responses in these arteries in the initial phase of digestion. After a baseline measurement in the overnight fasting state, healthy subjects ingested solid food (300 kcal) and water ad libitum within 5 min (4.6 +/- 0.2 min, means +/- SE), and then rested for 60 min in the postprandial state. Mean blood velocities (MBVs) in CA (n = 7) and SMA (n = 9) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured throughout the procedure. The MAP was divided by the MBV to yield the resistance index (RI). The MBV in CA and SMA started increasing within a minute after beginning the meal. The MBV in CA rapidly reached its peak increase (60 +/- 8\% change from baseline) at 5 +/- 1 min after the start of the meal, whereas the MBV in SMA gradually reached its peak increase (134 +/- 14\%) at 41 +/- 4 min after the start of the meal, reflecting a decrease in the RI for both CA and SMA. These findings suggested an earlier increase in CA and SMA MBV, implying that the increase of BF in some parts of the small intestine precedes the arrival of chyme.},

GLP-1 also synergises insulin-dependent net hepatic glucose uptake (NHGU). When GLP-1 secretion is deficient post-prandial SMA blood flow is not increased and as NHGU is also reduced, hyperglycaemia follows. Portal venous glucose concentration is also raised, thereby retarding the passive component of intestinal glucose absorption.~~, Increased pre-hepatic sinusoidal resistance combined with portal hypertension leading to opening of intrahepatic portosystemic collateral vessels are NASH-related mechanical defects that alter the balance between splanchnic and systemic distributions of glucose, hormones and incretins.The model reveals the latent contribution of portosystemic shunting in development of metabolic disease. This diverts splanchnic blood content away from the hepatic sinuses to the systemic circulation, particularly during the glucose absorptive phase of digestion, resulting in inappropriate increases in insulin-dependent systemic glucose metabolism.~ This hastens onset of hypoglycaemia and thence hyperglucagonaemia. The model reveals that low rates of GLP-1 secretion, frequently associated with T2DM and NASH, may be also be caused by splanchnic hypoglycaemia, rather than to intrinsic loss of incretin secretory capacity. These findings may have therapeutic implications on GLP-1 agonist or glucagon antagonist usage.},

Numerous mathematical models have been designed to predict with ever-increasing accuracy the behavior of oxygen transport by Hb in differing conditions of pH, carbon dioxide, temperature, Hb levels, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentrations that enable their applications in various clinical situations. The modeling techniques employed in many existing models are notably borrowed from advanced and highly sophisticated mathematics that are likely to surpass the comprehensibility of many medical and bioscience students due to the high level of ``mathematical maturity'' required. It is, however, a worthy teaching point in physiology lectures to illustrate in simple mathematics the fundamental reason for the crucial sigmoidal configuration of the ODC such that the medical and bioscience undergraduates can readily appreciate it, which is the objective of this basic dissertation.},

Although the energetic efficiency of masticatory effort is fundamental in understanding the evolution of the human masticatory system, nothing is known currently about the associated metabolic costs of chewing different items. Here, using respirometry and electromyography of the masseter muscle, we demonstrate that chewing by human subjects represents a measurable energy sink. Chewing a tasteless odorless gum elevates metabolic rate by 10 to 15\% above basal levels. Energy expenditure increases with gum stiffness and is paid for by greater muscle recruitment. For modern humans, it is likely that mastication represents a small part of the daily energy budget. However, for our ancestors, before the onset of cooking and sophisticated food processing methods, the costs must have been relatively high, adding a previously unexplored energetic dimension to the interpretation of hominin dentofacial fossils.},

  abstract = {Although animal models have been used to characterize the relation between oxygen consumption and blood flow, reliable data have not been generated in the human small intestine. We perfused segments of human small intestine by using an ex vivo perfusion circuit that allowed precise manipulation of blood flow and perfusion pressure. Our goal was to define the critical level of intestinal blood flow necessary to maintain the metabolic needs of the tissue. Human small intestine (n = 5) tissue obtained at transplantation harvest was transported on ice to the laboratory. A 40-cm mid-jejunal segment was selected for perfusion, and appropriate inflow and outflow vessels were identified and cannulated. Perfusion with an autologous blood solution was initiated through an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit. After a 30-minute equilibration period, arterial and venous blood gases were measured at varying flow rates while maintaining a constant hematocrit level. Arterial and venous oxygen content, arteriovenous oxygen difference (A-VO2 diff), and oxygen consumption (VO2) were then calculated. Our results demonstrated that at blood flows {$>$} 30 ml/min/100 g, VO2 is independent of blood flow (1.6 +/- 0.06 ml/min/100 g), and oxygen extraction is inversely related to flow. Below this blood flow rate of 30 ml/min/100 g, oxygen extraction does not increase further (6.3 +/- 0.3 vol\%), and VO2 becomes flow dependent. This ex vivo preparation defines for the first time a threshold value of blood flow for small intestine below which oxygen consumption decreases (30 ml/min/100 g). Previous animal studies have correlated such a decrease in oxygen consumption with functional and histologic evidence of tissue injury. This "critical" flow rate in human intestine is similar to that found previously in canine and feline intestine, but lower than that of rodent species.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regulation of plasma glucose concentration for type 1 diabetic patients is challenging, and exercise is an added complication. From a metabolic prospective, the significant exercise-induced effects are increased glucose uptake rate by the working tissues, increased hepatic glucose release to maintain overall glucose homeostasis, and decreased plasma insulin concentration. During prolonged exercise, glucose levels drop significantly because of the decrease in hepatic glucose production. With the long-term goal of developing a closed-loop insulin delivery system operating under various physiological conditions, it is necessary to develop a model that is capable of predicting blood glucose concentration at rest and during physical activity. METHODS: A minimal model developed previously was extended to include the major effects of exercise on plasma glucose and insulin levels. Differential equations were developed to capture the exercise-induced dynamics of plasma insulin clearance and the elevation of glucose uptake and hepatic glucose production rates. The decreasing liver glucose output resulting from prolonged exercise was modeled using an equation depending on exercise intensity and duration. RESULTS: The exercise model successfully captured the glucose and insulin dynamics during short- and long-term exercise. Model predictions of glucose and insulin dynamics during the postexercise recovery period were also consistent with literature data. CONCLUSION: The model successfully emulated the physiological effects of exercise on blood glucose and insulin levels. This extended model may provide a new disturbance test platform for the development of closed-loop glucose control algorithms.},

  abstract = {Aims: The aim was to determine the effect of meal glycemic load (GL) on blood glucose levels of healthy people with different body mass indexes (BMIs). Methods: Thirty healthy controls were included in this study. The participants were divided into two groups according to their BMI as normal group (BMI = 18.5\textendash 24.9 kg/m2, n = 15) and overweight group (BMI = 25.0\textendash 29.9 kg/m2, n = 15). Dietary assessment was done by the 24-h recall method for 3 successive days. Cases were fed by breakfasts with two different GL on consecutive days. Energy values of the test meal, adjusted to meet 25\% of daily energy requirements of each case, were identical in low and high GL meal (483 kcal and 482 kcal, respectively). Finger-prick capillary blood samples were taken on 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min. Results: Average daily energy intake in normal and overweight group was found as 2514.3 {$\pm$} 223.8 kcal, 2064.1 {$\pm$} 521.6 kcal and 2211.4 {$\pm$} 368.7 kcal, 2494.8 {$\pm$} 918 kcal in males and females, respectively. Blood glucose level was increased and remained more stable in both high GL meal groups compared to low (P {$<$} 0.05). The effects of GL on BMI classified groups were also found different. High GL meal was found to be more effective for increasing blood glucose level, especially on overweight group (P {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions: The effects of GL meal were found to be different on normal and overweight individuals. The high GL meals were more effective to increase the blood glucose level than low GL meal, especially on overweight people.},

  abstract = {The results of the accompanying electrophysiological study of the cloned Na+/glucose cotransporter from small intestine (Parent, L., Supplisson, S., Loo, D.D.F., Wright, E.M. (1992) J. Membrane Biol.125:49\textendash 62) were evaluated in terms of a kinetic model. The steady-state and presteady-state cotransporter properties are described by a 6-state ordered kinetic model (``mirror'' symmetry) with a Na+:{$\alpha$}MDG stoichiometry of 2. Carrier translocation in the membrane as well as Na+ and sugar binding and dissociation are treated as a function of their individual rate constants. Empty carrier translocation and Na+ binding/ dissociation are the only steps considered to be voltage dependent. Currents were associated with the translocation of the negatively charged carrier in the membrane. Negative membrane potential facilitates sugar transport. One numerical solution was found for the 14 rate constants that account quantitatively for our experiment observations: i.e., (i) sigmoidal shape of the sugar-specific current-voltage curves (absence of outward currents and inward current saturation at high negative potentials), (ii) Na+ and voltage dependence of K0.5sugarand imaxsugar, (iii) sugar and voltage dependence of K0.5Naand imaxNa, (iv) presteady-state currents and their dependence on external Na+, {$\alpha$}MDG and membrane potential, and (v) and carrier Na+ leak current. We conclude that the main voltage effect is on carrier translocation. Na+ ions that migrate from the extracellular medium to their binding sites sense 25 to 35\% of the transmembrane voltage, whereas charges associated with the carrier translocation experiences 60 to 75\% of the membrane electrical field. Internal Na+ ion binding is not voltage dependent. In our nonrapid equilibrium model, the rate-limiting step for sugar transport is a function of the membrane potential, [Na]0 and [{$\alpha$}MDG]0. At 0 mV and at saturating [Na]0 and [{$\alpha$}MDG]0, the rate-limiting step for sugar transport is the empty carrier translocation (5 sec-1). As the membrane potential is made more negative, the empty carrier translocation gets faster and the internal Na+ dissociation becomes increasingly rate limiting. However, as [Na]0 is decreased to less than 10 mm, the rate-limiting step is the external Na+ ions binding in the 0 to -150 mV potential range. At 0 mV, the external Na+ dissociation constant KNa{${'}$} is 80 mm and decreases to 24 mm at -150 mV. The external sugar dissociation constant KNaS{${'}$} is estimated to be 200 {$\mu$}m and voltage independent. Finally, the internal leak pathway (CNa2 translocation) is insignificant. While we cannot rule out a more complex kinetic model, the electrical properties of the cloned Na+/glucose cotransporter are found to be adequately described by this 6-state kinetic model.},

  abstract = {Objective: Numerous glucose prediction algorithm have been proposed to empower type 1 diabetes (T1D) management. Most of these algorithms only account for input such as glucose, insulin and carbohydrate, which limits their performance. Here, we present a novel glucose prediction algorithm which, in addition to standard inputs, accounts for meal absorption and physical exercise information to enhance prediction accuracy. Methods: a compartmental model of glucose-insulin dynamics combined with a deconvolution technique for state estimation is employed for glucose prediction. In silico data corresponding from the 10 adult subjects of UVa-Padova simulator, and clinical data from 10 adults with T1D were used. Finally, a comparison against a validated glucose prediction algorithm based on a latent variable with exogenous input (LVX) model is provided. Results: For a prediction horizon of 60 minutes, accounting for meal absorption and physical exercise improved glucose forecasting accuracy. In particular, root mean square error (mg/dL) went from 26.68 to 23.89, p{$<$}0.001 (in silico data); and from 37.02 to 35.96, p{$<$}0.001 (clinical data - only meal information). Such improvement in accuracy was translated into significant improvements on hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia prediction. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is statistically superior to that of the LVX algorithm (26.68 vs. 32.80, p{$<$}0.001 (in silico data); 37.02 vs. 49.17, p{$<$}0.01 (clinical data). Conclusion: Taking into account meal absorption and physical exercise information improves glucose prediction accuracy.},

  abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is an important interface of exchange between ingested food and the body. Glucose is one of the major dietary sources of energy. All along the gastrointestinal tube, e.g., the oral cavity, small intestine, pancreas, and portal vein, specialized cells referred to as glucosensors detect variations in glucose levels. In response to this glucose detection, these cells send hormonal and neuronal messages to tissues involved in glucose metabolism to regulate glycemia. The gastrointestinal tract continuously communicates with the brain, especially with the hypothalamus, via the gut-brain axis. It is now well established that the cross talk between the gut and the brain is of crucial importance in the control of glucose homeostasis. In addition to receiving glucosensing information from the gut, the hypothalamus may also directly sense glucose. Indeed, the hypothalamus contains glucose-sensitive cells that regulate glucose homeostasis by sending signals to peripheral tissues via the autonomous nervous system. This review summarizes the mechanisms by which glucosensors along the gastrointestinal tract detect glucose, as well as the results of such detection in the whole body, including the hypothalamus. We also highlight how disturbances in the glucosensing process may lead to metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. A better understanding of the pathways regulating glucose homeostasis will further facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metabolic diseases.},

Endogenous insulin secreted in response to the oral load exerts a somewhat larger effect to decrease hepatic glucose release (relative to the increase in glucose uptake from peripheral blood) than is the case when insulin is given by peripheral vein.},

However, a quantitative representation of the concomitant effects of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia on glucose clearance, necessary to describe heterogeneous tests such as euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps and oral tests, is lacking. Data from five studies (123 subjects) using a glucose tracer and including all the above tests in normal and diabetic subjects were collected. A mathematical model was developed in which glucose utilization was represented as a Michaelis-Menten function of glucose with constant Km and insulin-controlled Vmax, consistently with the basic notions of glucose transport. Individual values for the model parameters were estimated using a population approach. Tracer data were accurately fitted in all tests. The estimated Km was 3.88 (2.83\textendash 5.32) mmol/l [median (interquartile range)]. Median model-derived glucose clearance at 600 pmol/l insulin was reduced from 246 to 158 ml{$\cdot$}min-1{$\cdot$}m-2 when glucose was raised from 5 to 10 mmol/l. The model reproduced the characteristic lack of increase in glucose clearance when moderate hyperinsulinemia was accompanied by hyperglycemia. In all tests, insulin sensitivity was inversely correlated with BMI, as expected (R2 = 0.234, P = 0.0001). In conclusion, glucose clearance in euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps and oral tests can be described with a unifying model, consistent with the notions of glucose transport and able to reproduce the suppression of glucose clearance due to hyperglycemia observed in previous studies. The model may be important for the design of reliable glucose homeostasis simulators.},

OBJECTIVE: The metabolic effects of a high-protein diet were compared with those of the prototypical healthy (control) diet, which is currently recommended by several scientific organizations. DESIGN: The metabolic effects of both diets, consumed for 5 wk each (separated by a 2-5-wk washout period), were studied in 12 subjects with untreated type 2 diabetes. The ratio of protein to carbohydrate to fat was 30:40:30 in the high-protein diet and 15:55:30 in the control diet. The subjects remained weight-stable during the study. RESULTS: With the fasting glucose concentration used as a baseline from which to determine the area under the curve, the high-protein diet resulted in a 40\% decrease in the mean 24-h integrated glucose area response. Glycated hemoglobin decreased 0.8\% and 0.3\% after 5 wk of the high-protein and control diets, respectively; the difference was significant (P {$<$} 0.05). The rate of change over time was also significantly greater after the high-protein diet than after the control diet (P {$<$} 0.001). Fasting triacylglycerol was significantly lower after the high-protein diet than after the control diet. Insulin, C-peptide, and free fatty acid concentrations were not significantly different after the 2 diets. CONCLUSION: A high-protein diet lowers blood glucose postprandially in persons with type 2 diabetes and improves overall glucose control. However, longer-term studies are necessary to determine the total magnitude of response, possible adverse effects, and the long-term acceptability of the diet.},

Three models have been proposed: (1) a single carrier, (2) a single carrier plus passive diffusion, and (3) a two-carrier system. The objectives of the current studies were to define the transport model that best fits experimental data and to devise methods to obtain the kinetic constants, corrected for diffusion barrier resistance, with this model. 2. Intestinal glucose uptake was measured during perfusion of rat jejunum in vivo over a wide range of perfusate concentrations and diffusion barrier resistance was determined under identical experimental conditions. The data were fitted to the transport equations that describe the three models with appropriate diffusion barrier corrections, and the kinetic constants were derived by non-linear regression techniques. The fit of each model to the data was assessed using six statistical tests, five of which favoured a model described by a single carrier and passive diffusion. 3. The main conclusions of these studies are: (1) kinetic constants uncorrected for diffusion barrier resistance are seriously in error; (2) values for the derived kinetic constants are strongly dependent on the transport model selected for the data analysis which underscores the need for rigorous model analysis; (3) corrected kinetic constants may be obtained by either non-linear regression or by a simpler graphical analysis once the correct transport model has been selected and diffusion barrier resistance determined; (4) only corrected kinetic constants should be used for inter-species comparisons or to study the effect of specific interventions on intestinal glucose transport.},

  abstract = {The worldwide prevalence of metabolic diseases such as obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes shows an upward trend in recent decades. A characteristic feature of these diseases is hyperglycemia which can be associated with hyperphagia. Absorption of glucose in the small intestine physiologically contributes to the regulation of blood glucose levels, and hence, appears as a putative target for treatment of hyperglycemia. In fact, recent progress in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of glucose absorption in the gut and its reabsorption in the kidney helped to develop a new strategy of diabetes treatment. Changes in blood glucose levels are also involved in regulation of appetite, suggesting that glucose absorption may be relevant to hyperphagia in metabolic diseases. In this review we discuss the mechanisms of glucose absorption in the small intestine in physiological conditions and their alterations in metabolic diseases as well as their relevance to the regulation of appetite. The key role of SGLT1 transporter in intestinal glucose absorption in both physiological conditions and in diabetes was clearly established. We conclude that although inhibition of small intestinal glucose absorption represents a valuable target for the treatment of hyperglycemia, it is not always suitable for the treatment of hyperphagia. In fact, independent regulation of glucose absorption and appetite requires a more complex approach for the treatment of metabolic diseases.},

  abstract = {The worldwide prevalence of metabolic diseases such as obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes shows an upward trend in recent decades. A characteristic feature of these diseases is hyperglycemia which can be associated with hyperphagia. Absorption of glucose in the small intestine physiologically contributes to the regulation of blood glucose levels, and hence, appears as a putative target for treatment of hyperglycemia. In fact, recent progress in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of glucose absorption in the gut and its reabsorption in the kidney helped to develop a new strategy of diabetes treatment. Changes in blood glucose levels are also involved in regulation of appetite, suggesting that glucose absorption may be relevant to hyperphagia in metabolic diseases. In this review we discuss the mechanisms of glucose absorption in the small intestine in physiological conditions and their alterations in metabolic diseases as well as their relevance to the regulation of appetite. The key role of SGLT1 transporter in intestinal glucose absorption in both physiological conditions and in diabetes was clearly established. We conclude that although inhibition of small intestinal glucose absorption represents a valuable target for the treatment of hyperglycemia, it is not always suitable for the treatment of hyperphagia. In fact, independent regulation of glucose absorption and appetite requires a more complex approach for the treatment of metabolic diseases.},

  abstract = {Measuring insulin sensitivity during the physiological milieu of oral glucose perturbation, e.g., a meal or an oral glucose tolerance test, would be extremely valuable but difficult since the rate of appearance of absorbed glucose is unknown. The reference method is a tracer two-step one: first, the rate of appearance of glucose (Ra mealref) is reconstructed by employing the tracer-to-tracee ratio clamp technique with two tracers and a model of non-steady-state glucose kinetics; next, this Ra mealref is used as the known input of a model describing insulin action on glucose kinetics to estimate insulin sensitivity (SIref). Recently, a nontracer method based on the oral minimal model (OMM) has been proposed to estimate simultaneously the above quantities, denoted Ra meal and SI, respectively, from plasma glucose and insulin concentrations measured after an oral glucose perturbation. This last method has obvious advantages over the tracer method, but its domain of validity has never been assessed against a reference method. It is thus important to establish whether or not the ``nontracer'' Ra meal and SI compare well with the ``tracer'' Ra mealref and SIref . We do this comparison on a database of 88 subjects, and it is very satisfactory: Ra meal profiles agree well with the Ra mealref and correlation of SIref with SI is r = 0.86 (P {$<$} 0.0001). We conclude that OMM candidates as a reliable tool to measure both the rate of glucose absorption and insulin sensitivity from oral glucose tests without employing tracers.},

  abstract = {Background \& aims Knowledge of postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) dynamics is important in nutrition management and diabetes research, care and (self)management. In daily life, food intake is the most important factor influencing the occurrence of hyperglycemia. However, the large variability in PPGR dynamics to different types of food is inadequately predicted by existing glycemic measures. The objective of this study was therefore to quantitatively describe PPGR dynamics using a systems approach. Methods Postprandial glucose and insulin data were collected from literature for many different food products and mixed meals. The predictive value of existing measures, such as the Glycemic Index, was evaluated. A physiology-based dynamic model was used to reconstruct the full postprandial response profiles of both glucose and insulin simultaneously. Results We collected a large range of postprandial glucose and insulin dynamics for 53 common food products and mixed meals. Currently available glycemic measures were found to be inadequate to describe the heterogeneity in postprandial dynamics. By estimating model parameters from glucose and insulin data, the physiology-based dynamic model accurately describes the measured data whilst adhering to physiological constraints. Conclusions The physiology-based dynamic model provides a systematic framework to analyze postprandial glucose and insulin profiles. By changing parameter values the model can be adjusted to simulate impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance.},

  abstract = {The total amount of blood flow circulating through the heart, lungs and all the tissues of the body represents the cardiac output. Most individual tissues determine their own flow in proportion to their metabolic rate. The skin is a notable exception where the priority is thermal rather than metabolic. Renal blood flow and metabolic rate are related but plasma flow determines metabolic rate rather than metabolic rate determining blood flow. Brain, heart, skeletal muscle and the splanchnic area all vary their blood flows according to local tissue metabolic rate. Summation of peripheral blood flows constitutes venous return and hence cardiac output. Cardiac output is therefore, largely, determined by the metabolic rate of the peripheral tissues; the heart 'from a flow standpoint, plays a "permissive" role and does not regulate its own output'. This peripheral tissue, largely metabolic, determination of cardiac output has been known for many years. Evidence will be presented that blood flow is scaled according to a tissue specific ratio of oxygen delivery (DO2) to oxygen consumption (VO2). For the brain DO2 is approximately three times VO2, for heart muscle DO2 is 1.5 to 1.6 times VO2 and is very similar for skeletal muscle for moderate exercise. Brain, heart and skeletal muscle have the ability to sustain appropriate blood flow in the face of varying blood pressure within limits--the phenomenon known as 'autoregulation'. "Autoregulation, in regard to arterial blood pressure, has been observed" also "in the kidney" and "modest autoregulation" was observed "in the intestines and liver but not in skin". Guyton et al. have suggested that the term 'auto-regulation' should also include variation of blood flow in proportion to metabolic rate and the compensatory changes in blood flow which occur in the face of varying arterial oxygen content (CaO2). This article gives examples of the very precise compensation for CaO2 change in the form of sustained tissue specific DO2:VO2 ratios (corresponding with tissue specific oxygen extraction, E = VO2/DO2). The adequacy of this adjustment for brain, exercising skeletal muscle and heart is particularly striking; skeletal muscle will, for example when CaO2 is reduced, steal blood supply from nonexercising tissues sustaining its own oxygen delivery at normal levels.},

The intestine also harbors a large and diverse microbial population collectively called the gut microbiome (microbiota). The microbiome-intestine cross-talk includes a dynamic exchange of gaseous signaling mediators generated by bacterial and intestinal metabolisms. Moreover, the microbiome initiates and maintains the hypoxic environment of the intestine that is critical for nutrient absorption, intestinal barrier function, and innate and adaptive immune responses in the mucosal cells of the intestine. The response to hypoxia is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). In hypoxic conditions, the HIF activation regulates the expression of a cohort of genes that promote adaptation to hypoxia. Physiologically, HIF-dependent genes contribute to the aforementioned maintenance of epithelial barrier function, nutrient absorption, and immune regulation. However, chronic HIF activation exacerbates disease conditions, leading to intestinal injury, inflammation, and colorectal cancer. In this review, we aim to outline the major roles of physiological and pathological hypoxic conditions in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and in the onset and progression of disease with a major focus on understanding the complex pathophysiology of the intestine.},

  abstract = {The quantitative contributions of pancreatic responsiveness and insulin sensitivity to glucose tolerance were measured using the "minimal modeling technique" in 18 lean and obese subjects (88-206\% ideal body wt). The individual contributions of insulin secretion and action were measured by interpreting the dynamics of plasma glucose and insulin during the intravenous glucose tolerance test in terms of two mathematical models. One, the insulin kinetics model, yields parameters of first-phase (phi 1) and second-phase (phi 2) responsivity of the beta-cells to glucose. The other glucose kinetics model yields the insulin sensitivity parameters, SI. Lean and obese subjects were subdivided into good (KG greater than 1.5) and lower (KG less than 1.5) glucose tolerance groups. The etiology of lower glucose tolerance was entirely different in lean and obese subjects. Lean, lower tolerance was related to pancreatic insufficiency (phi 2 77\% lower than in good tolerance controls [P less than 0.03]), but insulin sensitivity was normal (P greater than 0.5). In contrast, obese lower tolerance was entirely due to insulin resistance (SI diminished 60\% [P less than 0.01]); pancreatic responsiveness was not different from lean, good tolerance controls (phi 1: P greater than 0.06; phi 2: P greater than 0.40). Subjects (regardless of weight) could be segregated into good and lower tolerance by the product of second-phase beta-cell responsivity and insulin sensitivity (phi 2 . SI). Thus, these two factors were primarily responsible for overall determination of glucose tolerance. The effect of phi 1 was to modulate the KG value within those groups whose overall tolerance was determined by phi 2 . SI. This phi 1 modulating influence was more pronounced among insulin sensitive (phi 1 vs. KG, r = 0.79) than insulin resistant (obese, low tolerance; phi 1 vs. KG, r = 0.91) subjects. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the minimal model technique to determine the etiology of impaired glucose tolerance.},

The highly vascularized lamina propria juxtaposed to an anaerobic lumen containing trillions of metabolically active microbes results in one of the most austere tissue microenvironments in the body. Studies to date have determined that a healthy mucosa contains a steep oxygen gradient along the length of the intestine and from the lumen to the serosa. Advances in technology have allowed multiple independent measures and indicate that, in the healthy mucosa of the small and large intestine, the lumen-apposed epithelia experience Po2 conditions of {$<$}10 mmHg, so-called physiologic hypoxia. This unique physiology results from a combination of factors, including countercurrent exchange blood flow, fluctuating oxygen demands, epithelial metabolism, and oxygen diffusion into the lumen. Such conditions result in the activation of a number of hypoxia-related signaling processes, including stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor. Here, we review the principles of mucosal oxygen delivery, metabolism, and end-point functional responses that result from this unique oxygenation profile.},

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) (1) and U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) (2) showed that treatment pro- grams resulting in improved glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c , reduced the microvascular complications of diabe- tes. The effect of these treatment pro- grams on reducing CVD was less clear. However, some epidemiological studies suggest that there may be a relationship between glycemic levels and CVD. In the management of diabetes, health care providers usually assess glyce- mic control with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and premeal glucose measure- ments, as well as by measuring HbA1c . Therapeutic goals for HbA1c and prepran- dial glucose levels have been established based on the results of controlled clinical trials. Unfortunately, the majority of pa- tients with diabetes fail to achieve their glycemic goals. Elevated postprandial glucose (PPG) concentrations may con- tribute to suboptimal glycemic control. Postprandial hyperglycemia is also one of the earliest abnormalities of glucose ho- meostasis associated with type 2 diabetes and is markedly exaggerated in diabetic patients with fasting hyperglycemia. Several therapies targeted toward lowering PPG excursions are now avail- able and have been shown to improve gly- cemic control as measured by HbA 1c . However, many questions remain unan- swered regarding the definition of PPG and, perhaps most importantly, whether postprandial hyperglycemia has a unique role in the pathogenesis of diabetic com- plications and should be a specific target of therapy},

Monitoring such risk factors in the general population is hampered by the inconvenience of venipuncture blood collection, particularly for both premeal and postmeal analyses. This study examined insulin and triglyceride levels in dried blood spots (DBSs) collected after different breakfast meal challenges to assess the potential of this method for risk assessment. METHODS: Glucose levels were measured using a glucose meter, and insulin and triglycerides were determined in DBS samples collected from 19 healthy volunteers before and at four time points up to 2.5 h after consuming each of five typical breakfast meals varying in nutritional composition. RESULTS: At 2 h, glucose was within normal postprandial values ({$<$}140 mg/dl) for all meals; significantly lower glucose was seen after meal 2 (the lowest carbohydrate content) compared to the other meals. Insulin returned to normal fasting levels ({$<$}15 microIU/ml) in significantly more subjects (90\%) after meal 2 and significantly fewer subjects (31\%) after meal 4 (highest carbohydrate content) than the other meals. Triglycerides were elevated to a similar extent in all subjects, with no significant differences between meals; levels were still rising at 2.5 h. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects were able to collect blood spots with minimum disruption to their normal daily activities. Relative ease of collection, analyte stability in dried blood, and the close correlation with serum levels that we have previously demonstrated makes DBS a convenient and simple tool for assessing the individual impact of different diets on postprandial dysmetabolism.},

  abstract = {The absorption of glucose is electrogenic in the small intestinal epithelium. The major route for the transport of dietary glucose from intestinal lumen into enterocytes is the Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1), although glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2) may also play a role. The membrane potential of small intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) is important to regulate the activity of SGLT1. The maintenance of membrane potential mainly depends on the activities of cation channels and transporters. While the importance of SGLT1 in glucose absorption has been systemically studied in detail, little is currently known about the regulation of SGLT1 activity by cation channels and transporters. A growing line of evidence suggests that cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) can regulate the absorption of glucose by adjusting GLUT2 and SGLT1. Moreover, the absorption of glucose and homeostasis of Ca2+ in IEC are regulated by cation channels and transporters, such as Ca2+ channels, K+ channels, Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, and Na+/H+ exchangers. In this review, we consider the involvement of these cation channels and transporters in the regulation of glucose uptake in the small intestine. Modulation of them may be a potential strategy for the management of obesity and diabetes.},

  abstract = {The unique biology of the intestinal epithelial barrier is linked to a low baseline oxygen pressure (pO2), characterised by a high rate of metabolites circulating through the intestinal blood and the presence of a steep oxygen gradient across the epithelial surface. These characteristics require tight regulation of oxygen homeostasis, achieved in part by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent signalling. Furthermore, intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) possess metabolic identities that are reflected in changes in mitochondrial function. In recent years, it has become widely accepted that oxygen metabolism is key to homeostasis at the mucosae. In addition, the gut has a vast and diverse microbial population, the microbiota. Microbiome-gut communication represents a dynamic exchange of mediators produced by bacterial and intestinal metabolism. The microbiome contributes to the maintenance of the hypoxic environment, which is critical for nutrient absorption, intestinal barrier function, and innate and/or adaptive immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract. In this review, we focus on oxygen homeostasis at the epithelial barrier site, how it is regulated by hypoxia and the microbiome, and how oxygen homeostasis at the epithelium is regulated in health and disease.},

  abstract = {Previous in vitro studies showed that the small intestine has reserve capacities for absorption of nutrients. However, the size of the reserve capacity is controversial. Therefore, we measured the intestinal capacity for absorption of energy in relation to the postprandial gastric delivery of energy into the gut. In minipigs, a 150-cm length of jejunum was perfused (1-8 kcal/min) with four nutrient solutions containing 60\% of energy as carbohydrate, protein, and fat, respectively, or containing 33.3\% of each nutrient. In separate experiments, gastric delivery of energy to the jejunum was measured after oral administration of four meals with the same nutrient composition as the perfusion solutions. With all nutrient solutions, intestinal absorption of energy demonstrated saturation kinetics. The jejunal capacity for absorption of energy ranged from 0.66 to 0.94 kcal . m-1 . min-1. Despite large differences in nutrient composition of the four meals, equal amounts of energy (1.3 +/- 0.41 kcal/min) were delivered from the stomach to the jejunum. The absorption rates of energy after meals ranged from 0.40 to 0.58 kcal . m-1 . min-1. Therefore, only 58.8 +/- 2.7\% of the jejunal capacity for absorption of energy was used. Additionally, the length of small intestine that would have been required for complete absorption was 42.9 +/- 3.7\% of the total length. Results indicate that the feedback control of gastric emptying provides at least two types of intestinal reserve capacities: a reserve in absorption (1.7 fold) and a reserve in intestinal length (2.4 fold).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The respective contributions to endogenous glucose production (EGP) of the liver, kidney and intestine vary during fasting. We previously reported that the deficiency in either hepatic or intestinal gluconeogenesis modulates the repartition of EGP via glucagon secretion (humoral factor) and gut-brain-liver axis (neural factor), respectively. Considering renal gluconeogenesis reportedly accounted for approximately 50\% of EGP during fasting, we examined whether a reduction in renal gluconeogenesis could promote alterations in the repartition of EGP in this situation. METHODS: We studied mice whose glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) catalytic subunit (G6PC) is specifically knocked down in the kidneys (K-G6pc-/- mice) during fasting. We also examined the additional effects of intestinal G6pc deletion, renal denervation and vitamin D administration on the altered glucose metabolism in K-G6pc-/- mice. RESULTS: Compared with WT mice, K-G6pc-/- mice exhibited (1) lower glycemia, (2) enhanced intestinal but not hepatic G6Pase activity, (3) enhanced hepatic glucokinase (GK encoded by Gck) activity, (4) increased hepatic glucose-6-phosphate and (5) hepatic glycogen spared from exhaustion during fasting. Increased hepatic Gck expression in the post-absorptive state could be dependent on the enhancement of insulin signal (AKT phosphorylation) in K-G6pc-/- mice. In contrast, the increase in hepatic GK activity was not observed in mice with both kidney- and intestine-knockout (KI-G6pc-/- mice). Hepatic Gck gene expression and hepatic AKT phosphorylation were reduced in KI-G6pc-/- mice. Renal denervation by capsaicin did not induce any effect on glucose metabolism in K-G6pc-/- mice. Plasma level of 1,25 (OH)2 D3, an active form of vitamin D, was decreased in K-G6pc-/- mice. Interestingly, the administration of 1,25 (OH)2 D3 prevented the enhancement of intestinal gluconeogenesis and hepatic GK activity and blocked the accumulation of hepatic glycogen otherwise observed in K-G6pc-/- mice during fasting. CONCLUSIONS: A diminution in renal gluconeogenesis that is accompanied by a decrease in blood vitamin D promotes a novel repartition of EGP among glucose producing organs during fasting, featured by increased intestinal gluconeogenesis that leads to sparing glycogen stores in the liver. Our data suggest a possible involvement of a crosstalk between the kidneys and intestine (via the vitamin D system) and the intestine and liver (via a neural gut-brain axis), which might take place in the situations of deficient renal glucose production, such as chronic kidney disease.},

  abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract plays a major role in the regulation of postprandial glucose profiles. Gastric emptying is a highly regulated process, which normally ensures a limited and fairly constant delivery of nutrients and glucose to the proximal gut. The subsequent digestion and absorption of nutrients are associated with the release of a set of hormones that feeds back to regulate subsequent gastric emptying and regulates the release of insulin, resulting in downregulation of hepatic glucose production and deposition of glucose in insulin-sensitive tissues. These remarkable mechanisms normally keep postprandial glucose excursions low, regardless of the load of glucose ingested. When the regulation of emptying is perturbed (e.g., pyloroplasty, gastric sleeve or gastric bypass operation), postprandial glycemia may reach high levels, sometimes followed by profound hypoglycemia. This article discusses the underlying mechanisms.},

The main question we are aiming to address is the relative effect of gastric empting time and luminal viscosity on the rate of glucose absorption. The results indicate that all factors have a significant effect on the amount of glucose absorbed. For low luminal viscosities (e.g. lower than 0.1~Pas) the rate of absorption is controlled by the gastric emptying time. For viscosities higher than 0.1~Pas a 10 fold increase in viscosity can result in a 4 fold decrease of glucose absorbed. Our model, with the simplifications used to develop it, indicate that for high viscosity luminal phases, gastric emptying rate is not the controlling mechanism for nutrient availability. Developing a mechanistic model could help elucidate the rate limiting steps that control the digestion process.},

  abstract = {Background Estimating the rate of glucose appearance (Ra) after ingestion of a mixed meal may be highly valuable in diabetes management. The gold standard technique for estimating Ra is the use of a multitracer oral glucose protocol. However, this technique is complex and is usually not convenient for large studies. Alternatively, a simpler approach based on the glucose-insulin minimal model is available. The main drawback of this last approach is that it also requires a gastrointestinal model, something that may lead to identifiability problems. Methods In this article, we present an alternative, easy-to-use method based on the glucose-insulin minimal model for estimation of Ra. This new technique avoids complex experimental protocols by only requiring data from a standard meal tolerance test. Unlike other model-based approaches, this new approach does not require a gastrointestinal model, which leads to a much simpler solution. Furthermore, this novel technique requires the identification of only one parameter of the minimal model because the rest of the model parameters are considered to have small variability. In order to account for such variability as well as to account for errors associated to measurements, interval analysis has been employed. Results The current technique has been validated using data from a United States Food and Drug Administration-accepted type 1 diabetes simulator [root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.77] and successfully tested with two clinical data sets from the literature (RMSE = 0.69). Conclusions The presented technique for the estimation of Ra showed excellent results when tested with simulated and actual clinical data. The simplicity of this new technique makes it suitable for large clinical research studies for the evaluation of the role of Ra in patients with impairments in glucose metabolism. In addition, this technique is being used to build a model library of mixed meals that could be incorporated into diabetic subject simulators in order to account for more realistic and varied meals.},

  abstract = {Oxygen supply and diffusion into tissues are necessary for survival. The oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)), which is a key component of the physiological state of an organ, results from the balance between oxygen delivery and its consumption. In mammals, oxygen is transported by red blood cells circulating in a well-organized vasculature. Oxygen delivery is dependent on the metabolic requirements and functional status of each organ. Consequently, in a physiological condition, organ and tissue are characterized by their own unique 'tissue normoxia' or 'physioxia' status. Tissue oxygenation is severely disturbed during pathological conditions such as cancer, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, etc., which are associated with decrease in pO(2), i.e. 'hypoxia'. In this review, we present an array of methods currently used for assessing tissue oxygenation. We show that hypoxia is marked during tumour development and has strong consequences for oxygenation and its influence upon chemotherapy efficiency. Then we compare this to physiological pO(2) values of human organs. Finally we evaluate consequences of physioxia on cell activity and its molecular modulations. More importantly we emphasize the discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro tissue and cells oxygen status which can have detrimental effects on experimental outcome. It appears that the values corresponding to the physioxia are ranging between 11\% and 1\% O(2) whereas current in vitro experimentations are usually performed in 19.95\% O(2), an artificial context as far as oxygen balance is concerned. It is important to realize that most of the experiments performed in so-called normoxia might be dangerously misleading.},
