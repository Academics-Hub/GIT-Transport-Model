# GIT Transport Model
A repository for a project in biomedical transport phenomena, modelling inputs and outputs of the GIT, as part of a full body transport model

## Pull request patterns
- All research-input sub branches should open PRs -> research-inputs
	- The same logic applies to the research-output sub branches
	- The research-inputs and research-outputs branches will be merged into main when we are finished researching.
- All code should be pushed onto code-staging, it can then be included in a PR to main
