- Hexokinase vs other enzymes 
- Kinetics for Carb breakdown in GIT
- Given O2 and Co2 input values
- arterial glucose
	- artery glucose + GIT absorbed glucose 
- gut glucose: glucose in GIT tissues
- Assumptions: 
	- all glucose from meal absorbed
	- all arterial glucose used by gut
	-> need to sort these out
- maybe use food values from recommended daily values?
- Gut.Glucose: current gut glucose + input glucose 
- Energy expenditure of digestion
	- mastication
	- digestion
	- absorption (carrier proteins?)
- LOOK AT PAPERS SENT BY JONO FROM VICTORIA
- find basal metabolic rate for GIT cells (during fasting)
- gut new: 
- Gut out: artery leaving GIT
- CHECK UNITS FOR O2 CO2 AND GLUCOSE 
- look for reverse ECMO system
- look for oxygen dissociation curve equation

Lit Review
- check research notes 

OFFICE HOURS MEETING - Wednesday	
- units for glucose output: grams vs concentration 
- energy usage of mastication?

VSCode: live share extension

Jono: glucose luminal function
Dinal: Gut calc: Glucose absorption
Julia: Gut calc help: O2 and CO2
